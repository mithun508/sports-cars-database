Sports Cars Database

This dataset is synthetically generated, containing information on 5,000 sports cars with characteristics modeled to resemble real-world data. It includes key automotive parameters such as horsepower, acceleration, price, fuel efficiency, CO₂ emissions, mileage, popularity, and insurance costs.
During the dataset's creation, we ensured realistic relationships between variables so that aspiring analysts could practice solving real-world analytical challenges. For example, more powerful cars tend to have higher CO₂ emissions, insurance costs depend on horsepower and rarity, and vehicle pricing is influenced by mileage, age, condition, and market demand.
